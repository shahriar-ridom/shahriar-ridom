    If it’s trendy but fragile, keep it. I prefer boring, battle-tested, and indestructible.

## ⚡ The Manifesto

Most developers write code to satisfy a compiler. I write code to satisfy a business model. Architecture isn't a luxury; it's the difference between a system that scales and a legacy mess that costs thousands to fix later. 

I live in the **Next.js** ecosystem for the speed, but I lock it down with **Fastify and PostgreSQL** because data integrity is a hill I’m willing to die on. If your stack doesn't have a schema, you don't have a product—you have a ticking time bomb.

**What I'm currently obsessed with:**
* **Systems Design:** Designing for the next 10 million users, not just the first 10.
* **Database Forensics:** Query optimization is where the real money is saved.
* **TypeScript Zealotry:** If it isn't type-safe, it doesn't make it to production. Period.

## 🛠 Weaponry of Choice

I don't play with toys. I use tools that produce results.

| Layer | The Arsenal | The Cold, Hard Truth |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | **Next.js / React** | Because SEO and performance aren't optional. |
| **Backend** | **Fastify / Node.js** | Maximum throughput, zero fluff. |
| **Persistence** | **PostgreSQL / Drizzle** | Relational integrity is the bedrock of logic. |
| **Logic** | **TypeScript** | Because I’d rather catch bugs on Tuesday than at 3 AM on Sunday. |
| **Environment** | **Linux / Docker** | Total control. Total isolation. Zero excuses. |

### 📬 Deploy Me

I’m currently **Open for Work**. If you need someone who understands that code is a means to an end—and that end is a rock-solid, profitable solution—we should talk.
